Game Description for Survive The Forest:

My final project will be an online board game in which a player
can move forward a certain number of spaces according to the number of the die they roll.
The player will start with a certain amount of life energy, and if that runs out before reaching the final desination,
then the player dies and the game is over. The purpose of the game is to make it to the end and survive.
Upon landing on certain spaces, the player will be prompted with a positive or negative situation.
The player will also encounter enemies and given different options. Every time the dice is rolled, the player loses 1 stamina.
